## **Project Title**

A closer look at college enrollment rate in the United States

## **Motivation**

One of the major social issues in the United States is the inequality in
the higher education. Finding the relevant factors which influence the
college enrollment rate in the United States can help the state and
federal governments and schools themselves to propose solutions to make
college accessible to people in different circumstances. Many studies
have shown that the geography is one of the major reasons for the higher
education inequalities. To investigate deeper, we plan to explore the
trend of the college enrollment rate from demographic and geographic
aspects, as well as the relationship between those and school type
(private school or not), and we want to investigate if there are
significant differences in college enrollment rate between different
states after adjusting other demographic factors such as income and
race.

## **The intended final products**

  - Any association between different income groups and the college
    enrollment rate?  
  - Any association between geography (states and if from an urban) and
    the college enrollment rate?
  - Any association between races or genders and the college enrollment
    rate?  
  - Any association between geography (states and if from an urban) and
    the college type?  
  - Any association between different income groups and the college
    type?  
  - Any association between races or genders and the college type?  
  - An national map which shows the details about the college enrollment
    rate and the college type

## **Data sources**

Our data is from <https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/>

## **Challenges & Planned Analyses**

  - The dataset is extremely big (about 200000 rows).  
  - The project may require many different maps, and the trend in these
    maps need to be shown clear.
  - Create an interactivity map shown the states and college enrollment
    rate & college type.
  - Create a plot shown the relationship between family income and
    college enrollment rate & college type.
  - Create a plot shown the relationship between different races and
    college enrollment rate & college type.

## **Timeline**

  - Week of 11/8: Data wrangling, exploration, and zoom review meeting.
    (Discuss what kind of results and graph we want to have)  
  - Week of 11/15: Create the website and each person work on one tab of
    the website.  
  - Week of 11/23: Write the report and each person work on one section.
  - Week of 11/30: Final report and screencast.
